# SIMULATING DATA, HYPOTHETIS TESTING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF HYPOTHETICAL DATA USING MATLAB

**This repository contains code written in MATLAB to perform the following tasks:**

SIMULATION

Simulating 1,000 samples of the cumulative count across a network of Geiger counters, choosing and justifying the correct probability distribution for the number of particles detected by each Geiger counter. I plotted the resulting empirical distribution of cumulative counts and the corresponding empirical cumulative density function, CDF.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING 

Using Simulated data above, I tested the hypothesis that the cumulative count across the network is larger than 400 detected particles in a 10 second interval at a significance level of 5%. 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

The file, 'burning_experiment.txt' contains a data set from controlled burning experiments on 25 commercially available scented candle brands. In the experiments, the amount of a poisonous gas (in milligram, mg) emitted for each candle brand was recorded alongside the amount (in mg) of two ingredients they contain. 

I performed a statistical analysis of this data and discussed how this experiment can be used to investigate the effect of each ingredient on poisonous gas emission and to make predictions about gas emission. 
I also made suggestions for how to improve the experiment and provided evidence for each statement. This data is hypothetical.
